Had a merge conflict when merging but-fix-experimental with bug-fix, I just opened in vs code and went line by line selecting what commits I wanted to keep and which one's i didn't.

The same with when I merged bug-fix into main, just went line by line and compared and then selected which one I wanted to keep.
